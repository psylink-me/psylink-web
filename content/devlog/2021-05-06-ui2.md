The new user interface now supports all previous features!

- Capturing muscle signals
- Capturing the keys that the user is pressing
- Training a neural network to predict key presses from given signals
- Auto-pressing keys based on incoming signals using said neural network to
  predict which keys the user wants to press

It's sooo much more pleasant to have a direct view on the state of the
application and an instant visualization of the signals.  The previous version
was literally just a blank window, with a single menu called "File" that
contained all the actions. :D  I never even bothered to upload a screenshot,
but here's one for documentation purposes:

Also, this time I used clean & efficient data structures to make the code
easier to work with, a more reliable key capturing library
([pynput](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput)), and threads to prevent one
activity from blocking the others.  The signals obviously go via Bluetooth
instead of a wired serial connection.

I'm also thinking of changing the name for the project, since people are
reading it as "my ocular" rather than recognizing the neologism made of "myo"
(for "muscle") and "ocular" (from "eye").  But all the good names are taken, of
course. -_-
