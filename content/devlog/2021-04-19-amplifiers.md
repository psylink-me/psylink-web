I have the feeling that before building the next prototype, I should figure out
some way of enhancing the signal in hardware before passing it to the
microcontroller.  It's fun to hook the 'trodes straight to the ADC and still
get results, but I don't think the results are optimal.  So these days I'm
mostly researching and tinkering with OpAmps.
