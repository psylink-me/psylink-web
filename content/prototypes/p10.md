An EMG neural interface with the following features:

- Modular:
    - A power module with [Arduino microcontroller](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble), battery, and power converter
    - 1-8 (typically 2) electrode modules with up to 4 electrode pairs each
    - Connected via standard 2.54mm (0.1 inch) dupont connectors
- Sampling rate of up to 500Hz, 8-bit resolution, max 8 signals
- Supports up to 17 electrodes total: 8 signal electrode pairs + 1 ground electrode
- Battery-powered (1x AAA battery, 1.2V, ~6h of usage)
- Wireless, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- AI-based gesture prediction and keyboard emulation (see {{% link "s3" %}})
- [GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) integration for plotting the raw signals + FFT

## Changelog

Changes compared to {{% link "p9.2" %}}:

- Fixed aggressive filtering of signals by changing passive highpass filter capacitors C1-C8 from 100pF to 100nF.  (This was covered in a [blog post](https://psylink.me/blog/enhancedsignal/))
- Replaced the [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) with a [Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble), since it has all required features at ~66% of the cost
- Replaced uncomfortable spacer screw electrodes with rounded dome nuts

Changes compared to {{% link "p9.1" %}}:

- Added PsyLink logo to PCBs
- Added "OFF" and "ON" labels to power switch
- Simplified power LED circuit
- Moved the external power pins (J7) away from the center of the battery, so the pin headers are not physically in the way when removing the battery.
- Better labels on electrode module
- Moved EX1 pin closer to EX5 and EX4 pin closer to EX8, so one can use a 2-pin pin header instead of 2 separate 1-pin pin headers, for faster assembly
- Jumpers to activate built-in electrodes are now closed by default for faster assembly. To disable them, please cut the jumpers carefully with a short knife.  To reactivate them, solder them together.
- Larger solder pads on instrumentation amplifier footprint for faster assembly
