This basically {{% link "p8" %}} with minor bug fixes, higher amplification gain, an optional power LED, and easier assembly.  See its description for more information.

Changes compared to {{% link "p9.1" %}}:

- Fixed aggressive filtering of signals by changing passive highpass filter capacitors C1-C8 from 100pF to 100nF.

Changes compared to {{% link "p9.1" %}}:

- Added PsyLink logo to PCBs
- Added "OFF" and "ON" labels to power switch
- Simplified power LED circuit
- Moved the external power pins (J7) away from the center of the battery, so the pin headers are not physically in the way when removing the battery.
- Better labels on electrode module
- Moved EX1 pin closer to EX5 and EX4 pin closer to EX8, so one can use a 2-pin pin header instead of 2 separate 1-pin pin headers, for faster assembly
- Jumpers to activate built-in electrodes are now closed by default for faster assembly. To disable them, please cut the jumpers carefully with a short knife.  To reactivate them, solder them together.
- Larger solder pads on instrumentation amplifier footprint for faster assembly
