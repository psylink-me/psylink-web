This is intended as a human input device (like a keyboard) that predicts your
intention from muscle signals. Using a neural network, trained through a
process where you press keys at the exact same time that you make movements
with the limb wearing the device, it learns correlations between the muscle
signals and intended keys, and can press them for you.

    - Transmits 8 signals at 8-bit resolution, 500Hz sampling rate
    - Linux graphical user interface for:
        - Mapping keyboard key presses to muscle signals
        - Training a neural network to predict key presses from signals
        - Simulating key presses based on neural network predictions
    - GNURadio integration for plotting the raw signals + FFT
