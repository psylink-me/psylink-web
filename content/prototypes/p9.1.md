This basically {{% link "p8" %}} with minor bug fixes, higher amplification gain, an optional power LED, and easier assembly.  See its description for more information.

Changes to {{% link "p9" %}}:

- Increased amplification gain on electrode modules from x51 to x501.  This
  increases the signal-to-noise ratio significantly.
- Reduced amplification gain of Signal 2 by half, compared to the other
  signals. (x251 compared to x501.) This compensates for a signal interference
  problem on the out2 trace of the electrode module PCB.
