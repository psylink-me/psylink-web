## Purpose

This is an (untested) improvement upon {{% link "b1" %}} and implements the
"Signal Processing Module" from [circuit 5.1](/c5.1) and [circuit 6](c6).
Essentially it calculates the difference between the voltages at the "in1" and
"in2" pins, after applying a high-pass filter through C1/C2, and a pull-up/down
through R1/R2 towards Vref to base the signal around the
center.

## Part placement

- C1: 100pF capacitor
- C2: 100pF capacitor
- C3: 100nF capacitor (exact capacitance not very important)
- R1: 1MOhm resistor, 1% variance
- R2: 1MOhm resistor, 1% variance
- R3: 1kOhm resistor, 1% variance
- INA128: [Texas Instruments INA128 instrumentational amplifier](https://www.ti.com/product/INA128)

## Pins

The "out" pin goes directly to the Arduino ADC (or perhaps through a
multiplexer)

The redundant Vref/GND/V+ pins can be used to wire multiple of these in a tree
network topology, where only the first board needs to be directly connected to
the power module.

## Details

- Dimensions: 20 x 16mm
