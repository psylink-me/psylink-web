Please refer to the page of {{% link "b2" %}} for documentation, because I
didn't know what I was doing  at the time, so this PCB has no silkscreen
labels on the individual parts.  The part placement, pin setup and
almost everything else is identical to {{% link "b2" %}} though.

The label says "myocular 0.5.1d", but obviously the [name of the project has
changed](/blog/new-name) since then.  The right label would be
"psylink.me/b1" which is also a link to this page.
