Please refer to the page of {{% link "b2" %}} for documentation, since the part
placement, pin setup and almost everything else is identical to that board.

The only reason why you might want to use this board over {{%link "b2" %}} is
that this board design has been produced, tested, and verified to work, while
{{% link "b2" %}} hasn't.

The label says "myocular 0.5.1d", but obviously the [name of the project has
changed](/blog/new-name) since then.  The right label would be
"psylink.me/b1" which is also a link to this page.

- Dimensions: 20 x 16mm
