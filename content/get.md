title: Getting A PsyLink
---

There are two ways of getting a PsyLink device:

## Building one yourself

The page for {{% link "p6" %}} has detailed assembly instructions, and the
schematics of all prototypes are linked on the [prototype pages](/prototypes).
If you require anything that you can't find online, [please let me
know](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/issues).  Make sure to tell me how
it goes! :)

## Order one

If you lack the tools or the time, I'd be willing to build one for you at
the approximate cost price.  If you're interested, simply contact me via
hutà»‘hut.pm.
