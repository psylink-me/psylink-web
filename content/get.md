title: Getting A PsyLink

[![PsyLink 6 photo](/img/prototypes/p8.jpg)](/p6)

## DIY

PsyLink is open hardware so you can just build one yourself:

- [Assembly instructions for Prototype 6](/p6)
- Schematics of all prototypes are linked on the [prototype pages](/prototypes)

If you require anything that you can't find online, [please let me
know](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/issues).  Make sure to tell me how
it goes! :)

## Ordering

If you lack the tools or the time, you're in luck:  For a limited time, we're
offering to deliver assembled prototypes at approximate cost price.

If you're interested, simply contact me via <u>hutà»‘hut.pm</u>
