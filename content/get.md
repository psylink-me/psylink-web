## DIY

PsyLink is open hardware so you can just build one yourself:

- [Assembly instructions for Prototype 6](/p6)
- Schematics of all prototypes are linked on the [prototype pages](/prototypes)

If you require anything that you can't find online, [please let me
know](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/issues).  Make sure to tell me how
it goes! :)

## Ordering

If you lack the tools or the time, I'd be willing to build one for you at
the approximate cost price.
