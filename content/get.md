title: Getting A PsyLink

[![PsyLink 8 photo](/img/prototypes/p8.jpg)](/p8)

## Option 1: DIY

PsyLink is open hardware so you can just build one yourself.

There are [various prototypes](/prototypes) and you can find their schematics
online. While we recommend building {{% link "p8" %}}, at this time, there are
only detailed [assembly instructions for Prototype 6](/p6).

If you require anything that you can't find online, [please let me
know](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/issues).  Make sure to tell me how
it goes! :)

## Option 2: Ordering

If you lack the tools or the time, you're in luck:  For a limited time, you can
request a pre-assembled {{% link "p8" %}} at approximate cost+shipment price.
