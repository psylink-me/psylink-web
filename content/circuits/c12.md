The base circuit with a power supply, reference voltage generator, several
configuration jumpers, as well as connectors for the Arduino and further
circuits like {{% link "c10" %}}.

You can change the values for R3, R4, and all capacitors by ~1 order of
magnitude without too much impact. R3 needs to be equal to R4.  R5/R6 may need
to be adapted to whichever LED and supply voltage you use, see e.g. [this LED
resistor
calculator.](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/led-resistor-calculator/)

To supply 3.3V instead of 5V, change the value of R2 from 110k&Omega; to
180k&Omega;.  This will also change Vref from 2.5V to 1.65V.

Do not connect all three pads of jumper JP9.
