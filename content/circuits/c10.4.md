Changes compared to {{% link "c10.2" %}}:

- Fixed aggressive filtering of signals by changing passive highpass filter capacitors C1-C8 from 100pF to 100nF.  (This was covered in a [blog post](https://psylink.me/blog/enhancedsignal/))
- Changed the gain for all amplifiers to 251x. (Some amplifiers had a gain of 501x due to a sensitivity bug, this is not necessary anymore.)
- The circuit preview image was generated by KiCad 6 instead of 5, and may contain additional cosmetic changes with no functional impact.

Changes compared to {{% link "c10.1" %}}:

- Gain resistors R9, R11, R12 have been reduced from 1000 Ohms to 100 Ohms, raising the gain tenfold, from 51x to 501x.
- Gain resistor R10 was only reduced to 200 Ohms, raising the gain to only 251x. This was done to offset an interference bug along the out2 trace of {{% link "b3" %}}, {{% link "b3.1" %}} and {{% link "b3.2" %}}.  Once this is fixed, the resistance should be set to equal that of R9/R11/R12 once again.
- JP1-JP8 are now closed by default, to save time during assembly
