## Ultimate Goals

The nature of this project is explorative, so there is not an ultimate goal
yet, but I have the following keystones:

- Building new input devices for computers based on neural activity and other
  data sources
- Enhancing the biological neural network with extra layers of artificial
  neural networks
- Privacy preserving free software & hardware, fully customizable and in
  control of the user

There's a wide range of possible applications, including:

- Providing input to a computer/smartphone without using a keyboard or mouse
- Enabling efficient computer control for disabled individuals
- Musical instruments
- Controlling smart home appliances

## Donations

I quit my job to work full-time on this project, so naturally I can only go as
far as my funding will take me :) If you like what you see here, please

## Can I get a PsyLink device?

Absolutely, and [there's a special page just for that](/get).

## How can I participate?

This project is so multifaceted that you can help in a lot of different ways,
from pointing out typos or design flaws to contributing code or assembling
psylink prototypes.  Whatever you find interesting and worth your time :)

Two good starting points are:

- [The list of open issues](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/issues)
- Contact the author (see above) and just chat about the project

And finally, just telling your friends about it already helps a lot :)
