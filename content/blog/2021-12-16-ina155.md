I tried replacing the [INA128](https://www.ti.com/product/INA128) chips on the
{{% link "b3" %}} with [INA155](https://www.ti.com/product/INA155) chips
with a Gain of 50, and it works just fine :) The signal even looks a little bit
cleaner than with the INA128, though I don't have good metrics to decide which
one is better overall.  They both have the same PCB footprint so I didn't even
have to change the board design :)

This is good news.  If I buy the INA155 chips in bulk (250+), they would cost
~1.75€ each (and I currently pay ~5.65€ per INA128), which would bring the
material cost of the whole product down from ~60€&nbsp;to&nbsp;~30€ plus
Arduino (~38€) plus shipment.  Even if the INA155 is slightly worse, that's
totally worth it.

At this price, it would even be affordable to use more than 8 signals (with
additional analog multiplexing, since the Arduino only has 8 analog inputs)
and wear more than two {{% link "b3" %}} at the same time.

Another big plus is that INA155 chips can easily work with a supply voltage of
3.3V!!  And I wouldn't need to boost the battery voltage all the way up to 5V
anymore, which is probably not very power efficient.

## CORRECTION

I did some more tests and concluded that with the electrodes that I'm currently
using, the maximum gain of INA155 is not high enough, and I have to
either find better electrodes, add extra amplifiers, or switch back to INA128
for the time being.  For now, the relatively expensive INA155's will have to
do.

But hey, the current electrodes are literally just... plain metal spacer
screws, so there is DEFINITELY room for improvement.

Here are some pictures of electrode placement and resulting signals, where you
can see that the INA128 (blue line) shows considerably more features:
