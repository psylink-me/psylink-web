I tried replacing the [INA128](https://www.ti.com/product/INA128) chips on the
{{% link "b3" %}} with [INA155](https://www.ti.com/product/INA155) chips
with a Gain of 50, and it works just fine :) The signal even looks a little bit
cleaner than with the INA128, though I don't have good metrics to decide which
one is better overall.  They both have the same PCB footprint so I didn't even
have to change the board design :)

This is good news.  If I buy the INA155 chips in bulk (250+), they would cost
~1.75€ each (and I currently pay ~5.65€ per INA128), which would bring the
material cost of the whole product down from ~60€&nbsp;to&nbsp;~30€ plus
Arduino (~38€) plus shipment.  Even if the INA155 is slightly worse, that's
totally worth it.

At this price, it would even be affordable to use more than 8 signals (with
additional analog multiplexing, since the Arduino only has 8 analog inputs)
and wear more than two {{% link "b3" %}} at the same time.

Another big plus is that INA155 chips can easily work with a supply voltage of
3.3V!!  And I wouldn't need to boost the battery voltage all the way up to 5V
anymore, which is probably not very power efficient.
