After some brainstorming, I changed the working title of this project from
Myocular to ✨PsyLink✨.  The close second favorite was FreeMayo (thanks to
Vifon for the suggestion).  Free as in free speech/software/hardware, and mayo
as a play on myo (ancient greek for "muscle").  But somehow I liked PsyLink
more.  It's inspired by the [Psionic
Abilities](https://shodan.fandom.com/wiki/Psionic_Disciplines) from the
1999's game System Shock 2.

FYI, this is the list of words that I considered, although unfortunately many
of the coolest combinations were taken:

- axon
- coil
- cortex
- cyber
- free
- gauntlet
- glove
- link
- loop
- magic
- mana
- mayo
- myo
- open
- pipe
- plug
- psi
- psionic
- psy
- psyber
- scan
- surge
- tron
- ware
- wave
- wear
