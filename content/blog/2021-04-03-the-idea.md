On this day, I got the idea and started researching EMG design and signal
processing, motor neurology basics, as well as existing projects.

Soon I realized that I will need a microcontroller to record and process the
signals.  I considered the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) and [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense), and chose the Arduino because:

- Bluetooth
- More analog-to-digital converter inputs
- [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) support, which would allow me to leverage neural networks for signal processing.  This is a bit of a stretch, can't wait to get disappointed by this :)

I wish there was a decent battery/UPS shield, couldn't find one so far.
