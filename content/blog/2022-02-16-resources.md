The [PsyLink Wiki](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/wiki) now contains two new pages:

1. [Next Steps](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/wiki/Next-Steps) documents potential directions that he project could take in the future
2. [Resources](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/wiki/Resources) points to external pages that are connected to PsyLink, similar projects, related news, papers, and educational material.

If you have suggestions for potential next steps or know about interesting links, please [let me know](/about.html), or add them to the wiki. :)
