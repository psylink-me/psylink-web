This is long overdue, but the following prototypes now each have a BOM (bill of materials) in OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods) format, including a breakdown of the raw material cost, in case you'd like to replicate them:

- {{% link "p6" %}}
- {{% link "p7" %}}
- {{% link "p8" %}}
- {{% link "p9" %}}
- {{% link "p9.1" %}}
- {{% link "p9.2" %}}
