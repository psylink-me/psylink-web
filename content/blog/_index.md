This is the development log of PsyLink, where I attempt to build an AI-powered
[myoelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electromyography&oldid=1016544188)
neural interface, on a budget.  It predicts your intentions by scanning your
muscle signals and essentially acts like a keyboard.

Why do any of this?

Neural interfaces are the future. I want them to be open and safe, in the
user's control, not the other way around.  In early 2021, the biggest players
in this field required invasive surgery and/or had poor incentives. Some
companies invited researchers to build applications for their devices, only to
sell them out later to Facebook and Google, while pulling their hardware from
the market, leaving the users dry.

So I thought, why not build one myself and open-source it?  Can't be that hard,
it's just bits'n'wires, right?
