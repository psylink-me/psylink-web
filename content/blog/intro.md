We don't have to drill a hole into skull to get access to your nerve signals.
Muscles naturally amplify them, allowing us to easily read them through skin,
and use them for useful things like controlling a computer or an artificial
limb.

This is not science fiction, check out what's out there already:

You could argue that we use our nerves/muscles to control keyboards already
(and pretty much anything else).  And for the time being, there are clearly
superior human input devices.  But there are reasons to do this:

- **Bandwidth**: Keyboards are limited to ~120wpm (~84 bit/s).  Hopefully we can squeeze out some more by sapping the nerves directly.
- **Hands**: Not everybody has them. You also may not want to use them, e.g. due to injury, or because they're occupied with other tasks.
- **Cyberpunk**: The books predicted there will be neural interfaces in the future, therefore we must create them.

This page documents my process of building one.  Note that I'm no expert and I
neither have a plan, nor do I know what I'm doing.  I just thought, how hard
can it be?  If [the architect of the Internet Exploder can build
one](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Reardon&oldid=1001294174#CTRL-labs),
surely I can do it to.
