The order of the PCB of {{% link "bp4" %}} has arrived, and so all the
parts for {{% link "p8" %}} are finally here :)  After some assembly (and
crimping of some rainbow-colored connectors that look a little neater than
those stray black wires from previous photos), this is the final picture:

## The Signal

A sample of the signal is this, using an [INA128](https://www.ti.com/product/INA128) with a gain of x228 and electrodes near the [flexor digitorum superficialis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexor_digitorum_superficialis_muscle):

The baseline is the midly noisy line around a value of 0.3 and shows the state
of rest.

The spikes and "spindles" (periods of higher amplitude) occured when I
performed various movements, like extending the arm, snapping the fingers, or
twisting the wrist.

## Bugs in the BP4

The {{% link "bp4" %}} is not perfect though:

- The solder jumper J8, that activates the central Screw 5, overlaps with the
  battery clip, resulting in a short circuit with the battery's ground, unless
  I put some isolation tape over the jumper...  Need to move the jumper further
  away.
- The power switch (SW1) is too close to the Screw 2, so the switch I wanted to
  use didn't actually fit, and I had to fall back to one that points off to the
  side, and looks a little awkward.
- I also wish that the analog pins were closer to the power pins, so that I can
  bundle up the wires, resulting in what would appear like one single
  connector, rather than two, per {{% link "b3" %}} board.  Although this may
  lead to EM interference between the wires, reducing the quality of the
  signal, so maybe it's actually better this way.
