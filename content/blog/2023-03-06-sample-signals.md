On popular request, I have uploaded some data sets of recorded signals, along with videos of their recordings.

They can be found in the new git repository ["psylink-datasets"](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink-datasets).  Here's a quick overview:

## Spelling Out "hello"

Here, I recorded 4 different gestures to produce 4 different keys, "h", "e", "l" and "o", obiously to be able to spell out the word "hello".

## Unlabeled Samples

Here I perform various arm movements and simply display/record their signals.
