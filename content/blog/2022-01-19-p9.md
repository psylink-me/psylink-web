News #1: PsyLink now has a Matrix chatroom: [#psylink:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#psylink:matrix.org)

News #2: PsyLink {{% link "p9" %}} is now out, which is pretty much the same as Prototype 8,
just with a few bugfixes and enhancements.  Notably:

- The Power switch now actually *fits* on the power module
- The Battery clip doesn't intersect with a solder jumper anymore, which used to cause a short-circuit unless you'd cover it up with tape
- The built-in electrodes on the electrode modules now can be activated/deactivated via solder jumpers, which allows you to use external electrodes *while* wearing the PsyLink regularily, without the built-in electrodes interfering with the signal.

Obligatory Picture:

It's less colorful and has more boards than the photo of the P8, but that's
just the type of wires, and an additional electrode module.  You could make the
P8 look the same way.
