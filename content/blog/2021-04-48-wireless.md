I've been battling with reducing the power line noise for too long, so I
thought screw it, let's go off the power line entirely.  I put the circuit on
two 3V CR2032 coin cells and wrote
[some code](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/src/branch/master/experimental/5_ble/arduino/BLEpipe2/BLEpipe2.ino)
to transmit the signals via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) using the
[ArduinoBLE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE) library.

Since I can not plot the signals via the Arduino IDE plotter anymore, I
switched to [GNURadio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and wrote [a plugin that
establishes the BLE connection and acts as a signal source in the GNURadio
companion software](https://codeberg.org/psylink/psylink/src/branch/master/experimental/5_ble/gnuradio/block_BLE_source.py)

My new "electrodes" also arrived: [Simple prong snap
buttons](https://www.prym.com/en/non-sew-refill-for-390120-smooth-cap-10mm-silver-coloured-390104).
They don't have sharp edges like the pyramidal studs I used before, and allow
me to easily remove the wires from the electrodes and plug them in somewhere
else as needed.

I also employed [INA128 instrumentation
amplifiers](https://www.ti.com/product/INA128), drastically reducing the
complexity of the circuit.  It's a tiny SMD chip, which I plan to embed in hot
glue, along with the 3-4 capacitors and 3-5 resistors required for
processing/de-noising, and place 8 of these processing units across the
glove/wristband, connected to two electrodes each.

Now I'm battling the problem that I can only get about 1kB/s across the ether.
How am I supposed to put 12kB/s worth of signal in there? (8 channels,
1k samples/s, 12 bit per sample)  Let's see if I can find some nice compression
method, but I fear that it's going to be lossy. :-/
