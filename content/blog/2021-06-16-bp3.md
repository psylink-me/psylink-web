Since {{% link "bp2" %}} has the wrong PCB layout for the step-up converter, I
built {{% link "bp3" %}} to fix this issue.

It was still a worthwhile learning experience to build {{% link "bp2" %}},
resulting in the following changes:

- Instead of stacking the Arduino and the Battery on top of each other (one on
  the front side of the board, one on the back), they're now side by side, to
  make the board flatter and fit better on the forearm.
- Added more capacitors all over the place
- Added various jumpers:
    - A solder jumper to enable/disable the reference voltage generator, in
      case I come up with a setup where I won't actually need it
    - A solder jumper to sacrifice one electrode and use its analog input pin
      to measure the battery charge instead.
    - Three configuration pins, connectable via jumpers, to change software
      settings on the fly and toggle between up to 4 different modes.  Or you
      can use them to plug in an extra module.
- Hopefully fixed the layout for the step-up converter

Here's the circuit:

And the new PCB:

[![PCB bp3 back side](/img/boards/bp3_back.png)](/bp3)

If you're wondering why the sparky, fancy looking power line goes all the way
from the power switch on the right through digital pin D10 and into L1 on the
left side...  Indeed that looks pretty awkward, but L1 is the noisiest
component, and I wanted to keep it as far as possible from the analog pins at
the bottom, without sacrificing the effectiveness of the boost converter
layout.  Given the size & time constraints, I didn't find a better solution.

What time constraints, you ask?  Well, actually I made a different PCB layout
first.  Polished every detail, and when it was perfect (according to my crude
appraisal), I ordered it.  Was already excited about the delivery, started
putting the board on the website, and so on.  But at some point I noticed that
something was wrong...  The Arduino pins were inverted.  Theoretically,
everything would still work, but the Arduino would have to be plugged in from
the back side, which is something I wanted to avoid to keep the board laying
nice and flat on the forearm...

Thankfully the manufacturing process hasn't started yet, and I could update the
board for free.  So I started redesigning half of the board and finished just
in time for the production to start :D

Let's hope it works this time.
