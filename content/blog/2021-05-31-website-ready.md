The website is more fleshed out now, with a nice black/green design, neurons in
the background, and a logo that is based on [the logo of the fictional
TriOptimum Corporation](https://shodan.fandom.com/wiki/TriOptimum_Corporation)
from the System Shock game series.

Videos are now hosted on a [PeerTube
Channel](https://peertube.linuxrocks.online/video-channels/psylink/videos),
allowing me to upload higher quality videos in the future while keeping the
[git repository of the website](https://codeberg.org/psylink/www-psylink)
small.

I also catalogued individual components ([circuit schematics](/circuits),
[circuit boards](/boards), [textiles](/textiles), [software](/software)) that
resulted from this project so far, and documented how they all fit together in
the [prototype](/prototypes) overview.  Each component has an individual ID
now, that I can easily write, print or sew on the hardware so I don't mix
everything up.  For example, prototype 4 has the ID "p4" and can be reached
directly via [https://psylink.me/p4](/p4), while the signal processing board of
p4 has the ID "b1" and can be reached via [https://psylink.me/b1](/b1).

Here's a screenshot, for a future time when the design has changed:
