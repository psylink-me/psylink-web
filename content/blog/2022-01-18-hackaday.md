Someone at Hackaday kindly invited me ("hut") to host a [Hack Chat about
Electromyography and
PsyLink](https://hackaday.io/event/183577-electromyography-hack-chat) on
Wednesday, January 19, 8 PM GMT.  There, I will answer all sorts of questions
from the hackaday community.

Drop by too, and watch me struggle for an hour to pretend that I know what I'm
talking about :)

Someone else at Hackaday also kindly wrote a whole [article about
PsyLink](https://hackaday.com/2022/01/07/psylink-an-open-source-neural-interface-for-non-invasive-emg/),
which sparked nice discussions in the comments, got the [P8 Demo
Video](https://peertube.linuxrocks.online/w/vELMqkNxjVWzxUj1f7eCeX) over 5k
views, and inspired several tinkerers to reach out to me about getting their
own PsyLink :)
